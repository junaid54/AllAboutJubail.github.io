    <h2 style="color:#d4af47;">JUBAIL's ROMAN THEATER</h2>
    <h3 style="color:#d4af47; margin-bottom:5vw;"> A hub for community engagement</h3>
    <p>Jubail has had a vast claim for numerous activities based for the community around the year. Especially , when it hosts the annual Flowers and Plant Festival.


    Many of such happen to be conducted in the Amphitheater very similar to a Roman theater !


    Located in the heart of the Al-  Fanateer beach , it's  clearly visible around the sea front.
     A semi - circular architectural structure with
    15 columns , it houses about 12 rows that could accommodate about 2000 people in one go.
    The arches add up an Islamic touch.

    Though this place doesn't officially have a name for it as yet , We as a family call  it the Roman theater.
    It does resemble the amphitheaters of ancient Rome , which provided a place for the public to go and see numerous events throughout the Empire.  They would feature races and gladiatorial events , plays, orations & public discussions.

    The only difference is that , The design in Jubail , with its semicircular form, enhances the natural acoustics, unlike Roman amphitheatres constructed in the round  form.


    Sunsets serves a beautiful time for some pictures reflecting the waves & these arches.
    Lighting is ample in the evenings & boosts a good location for some relaxation.

    Let's us know if you have been there!</p>

  <h2  style="color:#d4af47; margin-bottom:5vw;">AL JUBAIL :  A timeline</h2>
<p>We as a family arrived in Al jubail back in the 90s after a prior stay in the capital, Riyadh.
Father waes to start his new job with the Royal commission of jubail and yambu , after working with the ministry of agriculture and water in Riyadh for over 10 years.
And thus to a new start , we followed.


Having in contrast to our previous experiences , was the coast here in jubail.
Beautiful, isolated & almost untouched.
After the prayers & a heavy lunch ( mostly biryani , the tradition continues till date )
Friday afternoons was the weekly designated day for a swim. As kids we were regulars at nakheel beach. Adorable baby pictures ( papa was & is the original candid king ) prove evidence of our cherished childhood memories.

Now 2 decades later , we seemed not too aware of how it all started in this part of the world.

Jubail ,  surprisingly ,  has had a rich history all along.

For those who ain't too aware ,
Al Jubail ( ARABIC :  الجبيل  ‎ )also called as Al Jubayl  ,is a port city in the Eastern province on the Persian Gulf coast of Saudi Arabia.
The name , in Arabic , originates as "small mountain" that is apparently located in the northeastern  part of the city ( haven't seen one in all these years )


Earliest accounts in history roots  it back to 7000 years , being probably a part of the Dilmun civilization , which radiated all
Through eastern Arabia , particularly in present day kingdom of Bahrain.

Owning to the abundance of marine life and shallow harbor , the viability would have been quite prosperous for a settlement.

Pearl oyster beds offshore served as the chief financial aid for the families.
History suggests the old town of Jubail was dotted around with houses of these pearl merchants.
Pearl diving was rather a seasonal activity,
Particularly in the summer.
boats , traditionally called as Dows , seen much around jubail , would leave shores with the captains called (  nakhudas ) & the divers. The pearl merchants ( tawawish ) would finance advances for the season , which in turn would be returned by the boat captions on arrival.

Portable water wells were marked entities.
A pretty distinct landmark in the city is the well  on the western side. The well was the main source of water before the drilling of artesian wells. A tower called ‘Al-Tuwaya’ was built to protect the well following the orders of King Abdul Aziz in 1929.

In September 1933, Jubail gained a measure of fame as the landing site for the first team of geologists to explore for oil in Saudi Arabia.

Towards the  early 1950s, as large-scale oil production facilities grew up across the region, the traditional pearling industry had all but disappeared from the coastal waters of the Gulf.

Apart from the old town of Al jubail , which was until the 1970s, a small fishing village , the government of Saudi Arabia designated jubail as a site for extensive industrial development
& so the new residential area Madīnat al jubail aṣ Ṣinā`īyah was built.

In 1983,  Jubail industrial city project was cited in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest engineering and construction project ever attempted.

Towards the 90s the low sand dunes have developed into massive industrial installations , much Infront of our own eyes.
The flat salt beds around the coast still exists with a host of recreational activities for community.

It now houses the world's largest IWPP (Independent Water and Power Project) producing 2743.6 MW of electricity and 800,000 m3 of water daily , which proudly , dad was a part of for many of its early years in making.

With a population of 8,00, 949 it's one of the most planned & organized cities in the kingdom.
About 30% of the city has expatriates from a host of different countries, just like us , third culture kids.

It's been more than 20 years since we made jubail home.
And it's truly been a blissful journey.

<h2 style="color:#d4af47;margin-bottom:5vw;">The mighty KABSA.
</h2>
<p>Familiar , delicious & hearty !

Many of us have lived through this dish during our lives in the kingdom.
With its striking aroma around the nooks & corners of every city , it's got a balance of being called a complete dish !
With a cold drink to get it down the guts of course !

I must mention , it's a family favorite. Though in moderate amounts ,  Only during the weekends , once a week.
 In Jubail , we usually trust the Numerous Bukhari restaurants around jubail town for their perfection in the dish. Since the 90s , the taste has been pretty much the same ,  Prices , included !

The origins of this dish is in conflicts.
Some say Yemen , some say It's got its resemblance from paella ( a Spanish dish , consisting of leftovers cooked together )

The entirety of this dish  though remains in its making - the Rice & The meat.

Basmati rice is made aromatic with black pepper , cloves ,  cardamom , cinnamon , black pepper , bay leaves  , nutmeg  - augmented with carrots & raisins on top.
They even have pre made kabsa powder too now.

The meat used is usually  chicken . Heard a lot about camel & goat kabsa too , haven't given that a try as yet.</p>

  <h2 style="color:#d4af47;">Jubail - Dammam Highway</h2>
<h3 style="color:#d4af47;margin-bottom:5vw;">1st June , 2018</h3>
<p>Weekend is around the corner & dammam isn't too far away , accept , that it takes a toll of 45 minutes & some awful barren highway to reach.

We have been on this concrete pathway over a zillion times in our 20 years living in jubail.

FM signals ( we as a family enjoy some retro culture , hence no judgements when I talk about radio in the car living in the era of Gizmos ! ) from our very own ARAMCO  & quiet an inconsistent one from the neighboring Bahrain  ( 104.2 FM , a big yes if you enjoy some quirky Bollywood music ) always helps ease the time.

But there's a good enough reason to leave jubail late in the afternoon  - some scenic Desert hues along the highway!

We have serene sunsets here in this part of the world.
Reason ?
It's the Dust and moisture  in the air !


It's basic physics ,
light is made up of different colors & particles in the air,  which could be hundreds of miles away , such as dust and moisture , filter out the blues & gives u these divine reds & oranges  from the spectrum !

Added bonus , u can stare at these marvels straight off your eyes without any eye damage as the particles act as filters !

The jubail - dammam highway Is absolutely zero on vegetation or mountainous backdrop , which makes the land , oh so flat , perfect for a full setting sun.
Unobstructed, afterglow indeed !

So how do u know if the gods of photography are in your favor this evening ?

 Afternoon clouds are some of the best hints to get a picture-perfect sunset.
Start off early , right 1 hour early before magrib & see if you can spot these colours.
If it has rained , even better luck !

Share with us if u have found some along your way !
Happy weekend to everyone !</p>
